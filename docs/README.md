# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management process documentation. This repository serves as the central source of truth for how OctoAcme runs projects, ensuring consistency, quality, and alignment across all teams.

## Overview

OctoAcme runs projects with a clear lifecycle: initiate, plan, execute, release, and close/retrospect. Initiation focuses on a lightweight one‑pager that captures the problem, objectives, success metrics, stakeholders, and an initial timeline. This ensures that every project starts with a shared understanding of what success looks like and who needs to be involved. Planning converts approved initiatives into a prioritized, estimated backlog, defines a Definition of Done, identifies dependencies and risks, and produces a release plan with milestones. The overall approach emphasizes iterative delivery, customer value, and data-informed decisions.

Day-to-day workflows center on structured execution and visibility. Teams use a project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done) to track work as it progresses through development. Small testable pull requests and CI gating ensure quality and maintainability. Regular rhythms — daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, and demos at the end of sprints or milestones — ensure alignment across the team and with stakeholders. Pull requests include issue links, acceptance criteria, automated checks, and required approvals to support safe integration and maintain code quality.

Roles and responsibilities are explicit to reduce ambiguity and improve coordination. Project Manager (PM), Product Manager (PdM), Developers, and QA each have defined responsibilities that clarify accountability and decision-making authority. Stakeholder communication uses templates and a single source of truth (project README or release doc) with defined escalation paths for blockers and incidents, ensuring everyone stays informed and aligned throughout the project lifecycle.

Quality practices are woven throughout the delivery process. Teams write unit and integration tests, run end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows, and leverage CI security scans to catch issues early. Release checklists and rollback plans provide safety nets for deployments, while post-deploy verification confirms that releases work as expected in production. Retrospectives capture action items and feed improvements back into the backlog to drive measurable change, creating a culture of continuous improvement.

## How to Use This Repository

Teams should keep the Project One-pager and project README updated in the project repository to maintain a single source of truth. These documents should reflect the current state of your project, including objectives, timelines, stakeholders, and key decisions.
